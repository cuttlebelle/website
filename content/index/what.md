## What is Cuttlebelle?

Cuttlebelle is a static site generator that uses [react](https://reactjs.org/) for layouts, lets you use one layout per page-partial and cleanly separates
content from code.

You can extend Cuttlebelle with react components that can make use of the power of the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) ecosystem.
