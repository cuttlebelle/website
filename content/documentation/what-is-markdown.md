Cuttlebelle comes with a [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) engine.
Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML.

Following the example above, let’s add a line below the text that highlights where this text came from.

```markdown
The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling
phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours
which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the
interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants,
common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval
officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two
continents, were deeply interested in the matter.

For some time past vessels had been met by "an enormous thing," a long object,
spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more
rapid in its movements than a whale.

Excerpt from *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea* by **Jules Verne**

Here we added formatting to `Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea` by making it italic and `Jules Verne` by making it bold.
