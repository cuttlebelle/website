To start using Cuttlebelle make sure you got [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

**Install Cuttlebelle** so that the `cuttlebelle` command is available to you globally.

```shell
npm install cuttlebelle -g
```

Run the `init` command now to get you started with a bunch of files and a minimum layout.

ðŸ’¡ Make sure you run this in an empty folder

```shell
cuttlebelle init
```

This command will create the below files and compile them for you into the `site` folder.

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ css
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ site.css
â”œâ”€â”€ code
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ page.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ partial.js
â”œâ”€â”€ content
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _shared
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ footer.md
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ header.md
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ body.md
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ index.yml
â””â”€â”€ site
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ css
    â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ site.css
    â””â”€â”€ index.html

9 directories, 9 files
```

Now running the watch command will open the browser for you and show you what you got so far.

```shell
cuttlebelle watch
```

The address the server will listen on starts at <http://localhost:8080/> and increase its port number depending on what ports are available on your machine.
So the address you put in your browser could be <http://localhost:8081/> or <http://localhost:8085/> etc.
